### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    I enjoyed lab 4 because I learned to convert milliliters to ounces. It was a perfect lab for me because I always forget how many milliters it takes to fill an ounce. I will now be able to refer to my code instead of looking up the answer on Google. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because I was able to convert road signs into my code. I was able to specifically state what days and what times cars are able to park on certain streets. Now evertime I come across road signs I will associate it with my code.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was another favorite lab of mine. I love jersey mikes and perfecting my order to the way I love it. In this lab I was able to write code that will output the order that you preffered. All that is needed is your choice of protein, bread, and the condiment of your choice.
